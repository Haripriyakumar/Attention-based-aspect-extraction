# Attention-based-aspect-extraction
- Attention Based aspect extraction - an unsupervised neural network approach to find the coherent aspect and
analyze the sentiments on epilepsy forum comments from patients using techniques in Attention mechanism, NLP, Keras and
Tensorflow.
- Preprocessed and analyzed epilepsy forum dataset using the word2vec function from the gensim library.
